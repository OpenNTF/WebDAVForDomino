The test.nsf mentioned in the configuration / documentation is the database that actually contains documents with attachments.
There is NO special requirement for this database other that it needs to

a) exist
b) have the view you specify in the configuration
c) contain documents with attachments

In the current setup only e3diting of attachments via webDAV is supported, not creation
